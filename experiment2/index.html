				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I wanted to create an interactive art piece that changes over time.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I made a grid of images, the grid can vary in size and so can the images.
					I then made it so each image is spinning constantly, the speed they spin is affecting by
					relative distance to the mouse. The user can use keybinds to change between images, amount of images, size of images, rotation speed, 
					and a toggleable button to make the images grow and shrink over time.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project wasn't too difficult, the most difficult parts were deciding values for speed, grid size, image size, etc.
					That is why I added keybinds to edit those values at will.
				</p>
